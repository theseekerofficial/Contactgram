## Nginx Configuration

To use the web interface with a domain, you need to set up Nginx with the following configuration:

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Install Nginx

### On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt update 
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 2: Start and Enable Nginx
```bash
sudo systemctl start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

To check if Nginx is running:
```bash
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

### üßæ Step 3: Add nginx template

- Copy the `contactgram.ngnix` file in assets folder in this repo to `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` directory on your server.
- Replace the `your-domain.com` with your domain (No https://, http://, or www. prefix. Just the domain name like contactgram.com)
- Run the following command to create a symbolic link:
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/contactgram.ngnix /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
```

### Step 4: Test and Restart Nginx
- Test Nginx configuration using this cmd:
```bash
sudo nginx -t
```
- If you see output like 
```text
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```
- You are good to go. Restart Nginx using this cmd:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

- Good Job! You can now access the web interface at your-domain.com
